Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simualtions there were bigger values for the teams with higher ratings.
The mores simulations, the more lower rating teams appeared with a (small) chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 simulations adding more simualtions did not drastically change the proportions of percentages.
