## Notes

**algorithm speed** - measured in **O(n)**.

**big O notation** - O(n) - tells how many upper bound steps algorithm will take.

**Ω(n)** - tells how many lower

**O(log⁡ n)** - divide and conquer search algorithm

**O(n)** — our linear search algorithm

**O(1)** — the program always takes the same number of steps regardless of how large the input is.

**Big-θ** - theta notation, informs if algorithms have similar upper and lower bounds

**strcmp** - C function for comparing strings
