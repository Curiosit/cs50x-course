## Notes

**queue** - abstract data type, FIFO - first in, first out

**enqueue, dequeue**

**stack** - abstract data type, LIFO - last in, first out

**push, pop**

**free()** - frees the memory allocated earlier by malloc()

**realloc(list, size)** - reallocate memory

**(*n).number = 1 equals to n->number=1** 

**linked lists** - a struct that is based on value, and a pointer to the next value
