## Notes

**Machine code** - binary, machine readable code

**Source code** - code written by humans

**Compiler** - software converting source code to machine code

**Code quality** - evaluated by:
- corectness
- design
- style

**GUI** - graphic user interface

**CLI** - command line interface, terminal

**C Manual** - https://manual.cs50.io/

**"" vs ''** - in C the type of quotation marks matters. Single ones are for single chars, double ones for longer strings.

**counter++; counter--** - substracts or adds 1 to the variable

**integer overflow** - an integer overflow occurs when you attempt to store inside an integer variable a value that is larger than the maximum value the variable can hold.

**truncation** - truncation is shortening information by removing data at the end.
